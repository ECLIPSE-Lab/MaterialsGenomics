abstract: |
  This course introduces students to materials genomics, treating the periodic table
  and the space of known crystal structures as a searchable, computable design space.
  Students learn how materials databases are built, how atomic structure is represented
  numerically, how structure–property relationships are learned using machine learning,
  and how uncertainty-aware models enable accelerated materials discovery.

## Course Information

**4th/5th Semester – 5 ECTS · 2h lecture + 2h exercises per week**  
*Coordinated with “Mathematical Foundations of AI & ML” (MFML) and  
“ML for Materials Processing & Characterization” (ML-PC)*

---

## Course Philosophy

Materials genomics views the periodic table and all known crystal structures as a
**high-dimensional design space**.

In this course, students learn to:

- treat materials data as a structured, learnable representation space,
- move beyond classical descriptors toward learned representations,
- use ML models as surrogates for quantum-mechanical calculations,
- reason about uncertainty, stability, and discovery,
- understand how computational screening integrates with experiments.

The course explicitly **builds on MFML**:

- PCA and regression are assumed background,
- neural networks, representation learning, and uncertainty are used, not re-derived.

## Week-by-Week Curriculum (14 weeks)

### Unit I — Materials Data as a Design Space (Weeks 1–3)

#### Week 1 – What is Materials Genomics?

- Genomics analogy: genes → functions vs atoms → properties.
- Structure–property–processing paradigm from a *structure-first* viewpoint.
- Overview of major databases: Materials Project, OQMD, AFLOW, NOMAD.

**Exercise:**  
Explore Materials Project; query bandgaps, formation energies, symmetries.

---

#### Week 2 – Crystal structures, symmetry, and low-dimensional structure

- Crystal structures as data objects.
- Space groups, Wyckoff positions, symmetry constraints.
- PCA as an *exploratory tool* for structural/property data (refresher).

**Exercise:**  
Use pymatgen/spglib to analyze symmetry; visualize PCA of structural features.

---

#### Week 3 – Materials databases & thermodynamic quantities

- File formats: CIF, POSCAR, database schemas.
- Formation energies, convex hulls, metastability.
- What databases do *not* contain (bias, incompleteness).

**Exercise:**  
Parse CIF files; compute basic structural properties; analyze stability.

---

### Unit II — Representations of Materials (Weeks 4–6)

*(Aligned with early neural networks in MFML)*

#### Week 4 – From classical descriptors to learned representations

- Classical descriptors: Magpie, matminer (composition-based).
- Limits of hand-crafted features.
- Why representation learning matters.

**Exercise:**  
Build a simple property predictor using classical descriptors.

---

#### Week 5 – Graph-based crystal representations

- Crystals as graphs: nodes, edges, periodicity.
- Intuition behind CGCNN, MEGNet (no architecture deep dive).
- Relation to MFML neural network concepts.

**Exercise:**  
Construct a graph representation of crystals; visualize connectivity.

---

#### Week 6 – Local atomic environments

- Local vs global representations.
- Coordination environments, Voronoi tessellations.
- SOAP descriptors as a bridge to learned representations.

**Exercise:**  
Compute SOAP vectors; cluster structures in environment space.

---

### Unit III — Learning Structure–Property Relations (Weeks 7–9)

#### Week 7 – Regression and generalization in materials data

- Predicting bandgaps, elastic moduli, formation energies.
- Bias–variance and overfitting in materials datasets.
- Dataset size vs model complexity.

**Exercise:**  
Compare linear, random forest, and NN regressors on a materials dataset.

---

#### Week 8 – Neural networks for materials properties

- Neural networks as universal surrogates for DFT-level properties.
- Training pitfalls: data leakage, imbalance, extrapolation.
- Physical interpretability concerns.

**Exercise:**  
Train a small NN for property prediction; analyze overfitting.

---

#### Week 9 – Representation learning and feature discovery

- Learned vs engineered features.
- What networks “learn” about chemistry and structure.
- Transferability across chemical systems.

**Exercise:**  
Compare performance using raw descriptors vs learned embeddings.

#### Week 12 – Uncertainty-aware discovery & Gaussian Processes

- Aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty.
- Gaussian Process regression as a gold standard for uncertainty.
- Exploration vs exploitation in materials screening.
- Relevance to materials acceleration platforms.

**Exercise:**  
GP regression vs NN ensembles; visualize uncertainty-driven screening.

### Unit V — Constraints, Trust, and Synthesis (Weeks 13–14)

#### Week 13 – Physical constraints and informed learning

- Stability, charge neutrality, symmetry constraints.
