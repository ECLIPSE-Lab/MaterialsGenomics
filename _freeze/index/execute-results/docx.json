Students learn how materials databases are built, how to represent matter as numbers, graphs, or fingerprints, how to interrogate and predict properties of solids, how to use ML as a surrogate for quantum mechanics, and how to design new materials algorithmically.\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\nnumber-sections: true\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n## Course Information\n\n**4th Semester – 5 ECTS · 2h lecture + 2h exercises per week, together with ML for Materials Processing & Characterization**\n \n## Course Philosophy\n\nMaterials genomics treats the periodic table and all known crystal structures as a giant searchable, computable design space.\n\nStudents learn:\n\n- how materials databases are built,\n- how to represent matter as numbers, graphs, or fingerprints,\n- how to interrogate and predict properties of solids,\n- how to use ML as a surrogate for quantum mechanics,\n- how to design new materials algorithmically.\n\nThe angle is computational, structured, mathematically clean — the perfect foil to the messier experimental focus of other courses.\n\n## Week-by-Week Curriculum (14 weeks)\n\n### Unit I — Foundations of Materials Genomics (Weeks 1–3)\n\n#### Week 1 – What is Materials Genomics?\n\n- Genomics analogy: genes → functions vs atoms → properties.\n- Brief history: AFLOW, OQMD, Materials Project, NOMAD.\n- PSPP from the structure-first viewpoint.\n\n**Exercise:** Explore Materials Project; query bandgaps, energies, symmetries.\n\n#### Week 2 – Crystal structure fundamentals\n\n- Space groups, Wyckoff positions, symmetry operations.\n- How symmetry informs descriptors.\n\n**Exercise:** Using pymatgen / spglib to analyze symmetries.\n\n#### Week 3 – Materials databases & file formats\n\n- CIF, POSCAR, PDB-like formats.\n- Thermodynamic quantities in databases: formation energy, stability, convex hull.\n\n**Exercise:** Parse CIF files, extract primitive cells, compute density.\n\n\n### Unit II — Representations of Materials (Weeks 4–6)\n\n#### Week 4 – Classical descriptors & materials fingerprints\n\n- Magpie, matminer.\n- Stoichiometric, elemental, and structural features.\n\n**Exercise:** Build a small property regressor with Magpie features.\n\n#### Week 5 – Graph-based representations\n\n- Crystal structures as graphs: nodes, edges, periodic boundary conditions.\n- CGCNN, MEGNet architecture intuition (no training from scratch yet).\n\n**Exercise:** Build a simple CGCNN-like graph featurizer.\n\n#### Week 6 – Local atomic environments\n\n- Voronoi tessellations, coordination numbers, SOAP descriptors.\n- Role in interatomic potentials and ML force fields.\n\n**Exercise:** Compute SOAP vectors;
