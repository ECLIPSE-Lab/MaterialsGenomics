Students learn how materials databases are built, how to represent matter as numbers, graphs, or fingerprints, how to interrogate and predict properties of solids, how to use ML as a surrogate for quantum mechanics, and how to design new materials algorithmically.\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\nnumber-sections: true\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n## Course Information\n\n**4th Semester – 5 ECTS · 2h lecture + 2h exercises per week**\n\n### Position in Curriculum\n\nStudents take this immediately after \"Introduction to Materials Science,\" \"Thermo & Kinetics,\" and in parallel with \"Intro to Machine Learning\" and \"Machine Learning in Processing & Characterization.\"\n\nThis course teaches what those can't: how crystal structure, chemistry, symmetry, and first-principles data become machine-understandable.\n\n## 🧭 Course Philosophy\n\nMaterials genomics treats the periodic table and all known crystal structures as a giant searchable, computable design space.\n\nStudents learn:\n\n- how materials databases are built,\n- how to represent matter as numbers, graphs, or fingerprints,\n- how to interrogate and predict properties of solids,\n- how to use ML as a surrogate for quantum mechanics,\n- how to design new materials algorithmically.\n\nThe angle is computational, structured, mathematically clean — the perfect foil to the messier experimental focus of other courses.\n\n## 📅 Week-by-Week Curriculum (14 weeks)\n\n### Unit I — Foundations of Materials Genomics (Weeks 1–3)\n\n#### Week 1 – What is Materials Genomics?\n\n- Genomics analogy: genes → functions vs atoms → properties.\n- Brief history: AFLOW, OQMD, Materials Project, NOMAD.\n- PSPP from the structure-first viewpoint.\n\n**Exercise:** Explore Materials Project; query bandgaps, energies, symmetries.\n\n#### Week 2 – Crystal structure fundamentals\n\n- Space groups, Wyckoff positions, symmetry operations.\n- How symmetry informs descriptors.\n\n**Exercise:** Using pymatgen / spglib to analyze symmetries.\n\n#### Week 3 – Materials databases & file formats\n\n- CIF, POSCAR, PDB-like formats.\n- Thermodynamic quantities in databases: formation energy, stability, convex hull.\n\n**Exercise:** Parse CIF files, extract primitive cells, compute density.\n\n*These weeks anchor the course in solid-state structure — no overlap with experimental ML.*\n\n### Unit II — Representations of Materials (Weeks 4–6)\n\n#### Week 4 – Classical descriptors & materials fingerprints\n\n- Magpie, matminer.\n- Stoichiometric, elemental, and structural features.\n\n**Exercise:** Build a small property regressor with Magpie features.\n\n#### Week 5 – Graph-based representations\n\n- Crystal structures as graphs: nodes, edges, periodic boundary conditions.\n- CGCNN, MEGNet architecture intuition (no training from scratch yet).\n\n**Exercise:** Build a simple CGCNN-like graph featurizer.\n\n#### Week 6 – Local atomic environments\n\n- Voronoi tessellations, coordination numbers, SOAP descriptors.\n- Role in interatomic potentials and ML force fields.\n\n**Exercise:** Compute SOAP vectors; perform clustering in descriptor space.\n\n*This unit forms the representation backbone that processing/characterization courses deliberately do not duplicate.*\n\n### Unit III — High-Throughput Computation & Screening (Weeks 7–9)\n\n#### Week 7 – Quantum mechanical data and DFT basics\n\n- What DFT gives you: energies, forces, band structures, elastic constants.\n- Why it's expensive; why ML surrogates matter.\n\n**Exercise:** Run a toy DFT calculation (Quantum Espresso or MP workflows).\n\n#### Week 8 – High-throughput workflows\n\n- Automation: pymatgen, custodian, FireWorks, Atomate.\n- Data generation for building surrogate models.\n\n**Exercise:** Perform a small FireWorks workflow (or simulate the idea without cluster resources).\n\n#### Week 9 – Phase stability & the convex hull\n\n- Formation energies, metastability, hull distance.\n- Mapping an entire chemical system.\n\n**Exercise:** Reconstruct phase diagrams from Materials Project data.\n\n*This segment builds computational materials intuition — so students don't see ML as magic.*\n\n### Unit IV — Learning Properties from Atomic Structure (Weeks 10–12)\n\n#### Week 10 – Regression on crystal data\n\n- Predicting bandgaps, hardness, elastic moduli.\n- Comparing different representation families.\n\n**Exercise:** Benchmark random forest, GPR, CGCNN on a small dataset.\n\n#### Week 11 – Machine-learned interatomic potentials\n\n- Overview: GAP, SNAP, MTP, NequIP.\n- Role in simulating defects, diffusion, mechanical behavior.\n\n**Exercise:** Fit a tiny ML potential (ACE or simple SNAP-style) to toy data.\n\n#### Week 12 – Generative models for materials\n\n- VAEs, diffusion models for crystal generation.\n- Constraints: symmetry, stability, charge neutrality.\n\n**Exercise:** Sample a generative model from a pretrained online source; analyze validity.\n\n*This module provides the computational \"deep ML\" that other courses avoid.*\n\n### Unit V — Mini-Project & Synthesis (Weeks 13–14)\n\n#### Week 13 – Project workshop\n\n**Example projects:**\n\n- Predict bandgap from composition + structure representation.\n- Identify new stable compounds in a chemical system.\n- Build a graph-based model for elastic constants.\n- Use ML to approximate formation energies for a ternary subsystem.\n- Analyze SOAP fingerprints across polymorphs.\n\n#### Week 14 – Presentations & Reflection\n\n- Interpreting models: SHAP for materials descriptors.\n- Strengths/limitations of materials genomics vs experiment-driven ML.\n- How computational and experimental ML meet in modern labs.\n\n## 🎯 Differentiation from Machine Learning in Processing & Characterization\n\n### This course is never about:\n\n- microstructure images,\n- EBSD/SEM/TEM data,\n- spectroscopic signals,\n- processing parameters,\n- time series,\n- ML for microscopy automation.\n\n### This course is about:\n\n- crystal structures,\n- quantum-mechanical properties,\n- composition → structure → property learning,\n- descriptors & graph representations,\n- high-throughput simulation workflows,\n- structure-centric generative models.\n\nTogether, the two courses form a perfect dyad: one experimental, one computational; one rooted in images and signals, the other in symmetry and atomic coordinates.\n\n## 📘 Learning Outcomes\n\nStudents completing this course will be able to:\n\n- Navigate major materials databases and extract relevant structural/property data.\n- Represent crystals numerically using descriptors, fingerprints, and graphs.\n- Train ML models to predict quantum-mechanical and thermodynamic properties.\n- Analyze structural features via symmetry, coordination, and environments.\n- Perform high-throughput screening of materials candidates.\n- Understand and apply generative models for inorganic crystals.\n- Critically evaluate ML results in computational materials discovery.\n\n",
